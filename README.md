## About this project
Tic Tac Toe is my final project for CS50P with Harvard University Online. This game was made using Python and Pygame libraries.

## **main.py**

The main.py file contains all the code that will be executed when the program is run. It import classes Block and Board from the file board.py, which represent block in the board and the board itself, respectively.

The main.py file first inits the pygame library and declares colour variables that will be used to illustrate the game in the program. The main function in this file is where all others functions are called, and the game is controlled in this main function. 

The function draw is responsible for drawing the initial window and board into the screen as an interface of the game. The function draw first sets the background of the window to be black, then draw the board onto the window and then displays the current score between two players.

The draw_win function is called when there is a winner, and its responsibility is to display the winner of the round. The draw_score function is responsible for drawing the score for X and O players and Tie.

## **board.py**
