The main.py file contains all the code that will be execute when the program is run. It import classes Block and Board from the file board.py which represent block in the board and the board itself respectively. The main.py file first init the pygame library and declares color variables that will be used to illustrate the game in the program. The main function in this file is where all others functions are called and the game is controlled in this main function.
